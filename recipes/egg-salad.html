        <h2>Egg Salad</h2>

        <ol>
        <p>I suppose since I have recipes for Skillet Lasagna, Lasagna Soup, Lasagna Roll Ups, and Taco Lasagna, we are long overdue for me to share my <b>easy, classic lasagna recipe.</b></p>

        <p>This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a <b>creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. </b></p>
            
        <p>This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.</p>

        <li>
            <h3>How to Made It</h3>
        </li>

        <h4><i>See recipe card below this post for ingredient quantities and full instructions.</i></h4>

        <ul>
        <li>Spoon meat sauce on the bottom of a lightly greased casserole dish. </li>
        <li>Add 4 boiled lasagna noodles (or use no-boil or fresh noodles). </li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture on top. </li>
        <li>Add 1.5 cups of meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat the same layers two more times.</li>
        <li>Top with mozzarella cheese. </li>
        <li>Cover and bake at 375° for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove cover and bake for 15 more minutes. </li>
        <li>Broil at the end if desired. </li>
        <li>Let it rest for 15 minutes prior to serving with Garlic Bread With Cheese.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            <h3>How Many Layers Does Lasagna Have</h3>
        </li>

        <p>Lasagna needs to have at least 3 layers in order to constitute a true lasagna. Most recipes have 3 or 4 layers.</p>

        <p>I opted for 3 layers of 4 lasagna noodles as that is what will fit in a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish. Additional layers would require a deeper baking dish.</p>

        <li>
            <h3>Make Ahead Method</h3>
        </li>

        <p>Assemble as outlined but do not bake. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months.</p>
        
        <p>Thaw frozen lasagna completely before baking.</p>
        
        <p>Let chilled lasagna sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to baking. Add an additional 10 minutes to covered baking time.
    </p>
        <li>
            <h3>Reheating Lasagna</h3>
        </li>

        To reheat leftover lasagna: Place it in a lightly greased, covered casserole dish. Bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes.</ol>
