        <h2>Egg Salad</h2>

        <ol>
        <p>I think we all too-often forget about classic egg salad! It’s such an easy recipe to make and is something you can pull from the fridge at a moment’s notice to eat by itself or make sandwiches or lettuce wraps.</b></p>

        <p>Feel free to add some fresh lettuce, arugula, sliced tomato, avocado, and crispy bacon to those sandwiches to take things up a notch!</p>
