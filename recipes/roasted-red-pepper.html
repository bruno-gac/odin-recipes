        <h2>Roasted Red Pepper</h2>

        <ol>
        <p>It starts off by blending roasted red peppers and chicken broth for a smooth consistency.</p>
        <p>The sauce is further enhanced by adding heavy cream, a touch of hot sauce (which doesnâ€™t make it spicy), and a perfect blend of seasonings.</p>

        <p>From there we reduce a little bit of white wine which acts as a flavor enhancer.</p>
        <p>A roux is then prepared and the roasted red pepper mixture is added to it along with a 2-cheese blend of Parmesan and Asiago.</p>
        <p>Stir in some linguine and you are ready to eat!</p>
